# nCOVID 19 India Stats Dashboard
Shows you state wise data and inforamation related to nCovid 19.
This web app is created with react.

### Features used in react
- Hook (For creating a global store for state management)
    - createContext
    - useContext
    - useReducer

### Css framework used:
- Bulma.css

Bulma css is really very light weight and since there is no need of other js libraries like jquery, this makes loading a bit fast. Apart from this I like many of its simple class shorthands and components it provides. I customised the colors by overriding the class rules in another css file i.e; App.css in this project.
